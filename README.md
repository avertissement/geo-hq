<h1>Geography HQ (API-CAPSTONE PROJECT)</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>


<p>
This project was assigned to me to build completely from scratch, by myself, and using only appropriate resources. It took me less than the average time to build
(average time is over the course of 2 weeks; for me, it was 1). This was assigned to me and has been to others to test the knowledge of APIs and how to properly
utilize them, as well as aggregating all the other skills learned thus far.

<h2>Concerns and Notes</h2>


<p>
I do realize that I have many files and many lines of code within those files (particularly quiz.js; this has over 1200 lines of code) that could have been reduced
and made just as effective as before. I have not changed this because given my circumstances and knowledge at this point, it is reasonable to say that this is 
appropriate, for now. There are some other concerns I neglected to fix but aren't major issues, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the end of the quiz in the mobile-first view, the footer does not fill in as much space as it needs to.</li>
  <li>While accessibility is adequate, it could also be improved by some measure (i.e., narrowing down exactly what visually impaired users need to hear or making it so that an individual does not need to press "tab" so much in order to get to the button(s) they need to press).</li>
  <li>The overall design. While I certainly am aware of the fact that the design is not up to par with standards that dictate modern and sleek webpages of today, it is appropriate for my current standing, and I will be utilizing the skills of another software developer to improve the design.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Concerns and Notes</h2>


<p>
Overall, I am pleased with the finished product. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in any way and let me know of feedback you may have. Currently, I have
4-5 more months of training left before I can be considered a full-stack developer.
