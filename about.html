        <h2>Elliott Day</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I was very young, coding was something I was interested in and seriously considered getting involved with. 
            However, I did not have the resources or means to do so at the time. Now, many years later, I finally get to realize that dream. 
            Besides coding, I have always been involved in music and have played the organ, piano, and even sung in multiple choirs. 
            I continue to do those things even today. My major at the University of Utah is accountancy, although, as I said earlier, I am 
            taking a temporary leave of absence from attending the school due to personal reasons. However, I plan to return and acquire my degree 
            beginning in Fall 2021. In the future, I want to have an arsenal of skills (such as expertise in Javascript, CSS, HTML, Java, C++, React, and more)
            so that I can exceed a client's expectations.
